Wraps SDL functions into a more abstracted system that simplifies a 2D game
creation

Build requirements
 - SDL 2.0 (http://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)
 - SDL Image 2.0 (https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/)
 - SDL Mixer 2.0 (https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/)

Notes:
 - This project comes with a Makefile for unix-like systems
 - These project files assume SDL, SDL_mixer and SDL_image are located inside of
"SDL2" folder and part of your search paths (SDL2/SDL.h)
 - Build files using a compatible c++11 compiler (G++ by default)

This project is a fork from the original project from:
